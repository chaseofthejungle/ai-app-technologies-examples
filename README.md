## 1. <a name="frontend">Front-End Technologies</a>

Front-end web technologies/mechanisms interface directly with the user. Web page structure, styling, and interactive elements are defined by front-end technologies. Example technologies include:

* **HTML5:** The current version of HyperText Markup Language (a scripting language used to structure web pages and their content).
* **CSS3:** The current version of Cascading Style Sheets (allows for rules that style and layout web pages and their elements, applied in order of stated preference). 
  + **Tailwind CSS:** A CSS framework that enables the building and designing of web pages directly into HTML.
* **Flutter:** An open-source Software Development Kit (SDK) provided by Google for developing and stylizing multi-platform apps.
* **JavaScript:** Enables develops to create dynamic and interactive web pages, including real-time data, form input validation mechanisms, and animation effects. 
  + **React:** A JavaScript library used for building out both single page and multiple page user interfaces.
    - **Next.js:** A React framework with additional features, such as server-side functionalities, simplified routing, and performance optimization.
  + **Angular:** An open-source Java development framework for building complex single-page web apps. Tends to have a higher learning curve than React, as it is a framework and not just a library.
* **Swift:** An open-source programming language developed by Apple that is often used to develop iOS apps.
* **Kotlin:** An open-source programming language developed by JetBrains that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is often used to develop Android apps.
